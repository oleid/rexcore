# rexcore

A very simple experiment to create something like [FlexCore](https://github.com/FlexCoreLib/flexcore) in rust.

Currently, there is no scheduler and thus, works only single-threaded by issuing fire() on a source manually.

## Usage

Please have a look at [the examples](examples/akkumulator.rs).
